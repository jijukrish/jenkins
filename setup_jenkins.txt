Setup Jenkins in centos
Step 1: Install Open jdk11
Step 2: Install jenkins repo to centos repo dir
	sudo curl --silent --location http://pkg.jenkins-ci.org/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo
	Output will be
	[jenkins]
	name=Jenkins-stable
	baseurl=http://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable
	gpgcheck=1

Step 3: Import key
	sudo rpm --import https://jenkins-ci.org/redhat/jenkins-ci.org.key
	
Step 4: Install stable jenkins on centos 7
	sudo yum install jenkins 
	
user name I created  - jenkinsadmin
vmadmin is vmadmin
==================================================
install jenkins slave
create a VM in azure (B1s with 4GB and 8GB SSD) . Install centos
Now perform foloowing steps
Login to VM\
sudo yum update
sudo yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk git

create a user for jenkins to connect to slave and run jobs
sudo useradd -d /var/lib/jenkins jenkins

generate a key for user by running below cmd
ssh-keygen
This command will provide a series of prompts. Feel free to use the defaults. From a security perspective, it may be a good idea to enter a passphrase when prompted, and if you do so make sure you take note of the passphrase you used since you will need it later. This command will output two files: id_rsa and id_rsa.pub. If you’re already familiar with the process of working with ssh keys in Linux, this will be very familiar to you, but if not, don’t worry. I’ll walk you through how to use these keys! By default, these files are located in ~/.ssh/. When you run ssh-keygen, you have the option of specifying another location.

-rw-------. 1 vmadmin vmadmin    0 Oct 31 03:35 authorized_keys
-rw-r--r--. 1 vmadmin vmadmin  399 Oct 31 04:09 id_rsa.pub
-rw-------. 1 vmadmin vmadmin 1679 Oct 31 04:09 id_rsa

Add the public key to the authorized_keys file of the jenkins user on the agent node.
Next, we need to add the public key (the contents of id_rsa.pub) to the authorized_keys file of the jenkins user that we created earlier. This will allow anyone who has the private key (in our case, the Jenkins master) to log in to the agent node as the jenkins user. First, we need to create the directory that the authorized_keys file belongs in, and then we can create the file itself:

sudo mkdir /var/lib/jenkins/.ssh
